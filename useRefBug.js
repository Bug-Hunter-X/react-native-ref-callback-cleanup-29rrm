This error occurs when using the `useRef` hook in React Native with a component that is unmounted before the callback function in `useRef` is executed.  This can happen if you're doing something asynchronous, like fetching data, and the component unmounts before the data is fetched and the callback is triggered.  The solution involves adding a check to see if the component is still mounted before executing the callback.
